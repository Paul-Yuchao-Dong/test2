When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
in case team need to work together and in case you have more machines to work on.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
the GitHub essentially publishes all the changes to the world, if your users are requiring a stable utility, then you may want to finalize things before implement more experimental stuff.
